*textobj-line* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select a portion of
the current line.  Sometimes you want to select a portion of the current line
like "^vg_" or "0v$h".  This plugin provides the text objects for such ranges.

For example, if the current line equals to "__foo_bar_baz__" (where "_"
represents a whitespace character), you can select "foo_bar_baz" (without
leading and trailing spaces) by |<Plug>(textobj-line-i)| and "__foo_bar_baz__"
(with leading and trailing spaces) by |<Plug>(textobj-line-a)|.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.8 or later (vimscript#2100)
